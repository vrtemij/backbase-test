#Backbase test movie app
This spring boot application allows user to give a rating to the specific movie and add this movie to users's library based on movie title.
It also allows user to check if searched movie won Best Picture Oscar nomination based on movie title.
I implemented basic auth for user, so we only have one user right now, i'm parsing csv file on the start of the project to reduce time for preparation in future it can be done for once, project has integration tests
